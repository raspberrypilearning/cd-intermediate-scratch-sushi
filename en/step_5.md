## Asking for input

Ok, this is getting pretty cool, but it’s a bit of a headache to have to edit your code every time you want to see a different pattern. Wouldn’t it be good to get the program to ask you for them? You can do that!

+ First, create **variables** in **data** for `degrees`{:class="blockdata"} and `increase`{:class="blockdata"} and add them to your code like this: 

```blocks
    repeat until <touching [edge v] ?> 
        move (steps) steps
        turn cw (degrees) degrees
        change [steps v] by (increase)
    end
```

+ Now you need to ask for values for these two **variables** and store them. You do this using a sensing block called `Ask and wait`{:class="blocksensing"}, which you can type a question into. Pull one into your **sprite panel** and change the question to `How many steps should I grow by?`, then add it to your program, just after you set `steps`{:class="blockdata"} to `0`, like this: 

```blocks
    when green flag clicked
    set [steps v] to [0]
    ask [How many steps should I grow by?] and wait
    pen up
```

Once you’ve got Scratch asking a question, you need it to remember the answer! It turns out that Scratch has a special **variable**, called `answer`{:class="blocksensing"}, where it puts the most recent answer it’s received. You can find it among the **sensing** blocks. 

+ Using a **data** `set to `{:class="blockdata"} block, take the value from `answer`{:class="blocksensing"} and give it to `increase`{:class="blockdata"} like so: 

```blocks
    ask [How many steps should I grow by?] and wait
    set [increase v] to (answer)
```

+ Now, do the same thing with `degrees`{:class="blockdata"}, asking `How many degrees should I turn?` and storing the `answer`{:class="blocksensing"} in `degrees`{:class="blockdata"}. 

```blocks
    set [increase v] to (answer)
    ask [How many degrees should I turn?] and wait
    set [degrees v] to (answer)
```

+ Check your program now looks like the one below and run it a few times, trying different numbers. Write down the answers that make the coolest pictures. You’ll need them on a later card! 

```blocks
    when green flag clicked
    set [steps v] to [0]
    ask [How many steps should I grow by?] and wait
    set [increase v] to (answer)
    ask [How many degrees should I turn?] and wait
    set [degrees v] to (answer)
    pen up
    hide
    clear
    go to x: (0) y: (0)
    set pen color to [#4a6cd4]
    pen down
    repeat until <touching [edge v] ?> 
        move (steps) steps
        turn cw (degrees) degrees
        change [steps v] by (increase)
    end
```
