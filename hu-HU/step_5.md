## Cooler lines

Time to add colour! Right now, your line is one colour, but the **Pen** has blocks that can change its colour. And with the right **Operator** block, you can even change the colour randomly!

The block for changing the **Pen** colour is `change pen color by`{:class="block3extensions"}:

```blocks3
    change pen color by (10)
```

\--- task \--- Grab one of those blocks and put it into your `repeat until`{:class="block3control"} loop, like this:

```blocks3
    repeat until <touching [edge v] ?> 
+        change pen color by (10)
        move (steps) steps
        turn cw (degrees ::variables) degrees
        change [steps v] by (increase ::variables)
    end
```

\--- /task \---

Thatâ€™s cool, but a bit predictable. You can make it a bit more fun if you add a random number into it, so the colour changes randomly.

\--- task \--- Put the random number **Operator** block into the `change pen color by`{:class="block3extensions"} block and pick some values to go in it. I'd try `1` and `100` to start.

```blocks3
    repeat until <touching [edge v] ?> 
+        change pen color by (pick random (1) to (100))
        move (steps) steps
        turn cw (degrees ::variables) degrees
        change [steps v] by (increase ::variables)
    end
```
